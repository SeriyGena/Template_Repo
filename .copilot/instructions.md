Ensure all generated code is highly readable and self-documenting.
Always add comments to explain complex or non-obvious logic.
Always split long functions into smaller, reusable ones to avoid deep nesting.
Always use docstrings to document functions and classes, explaining purpose, arguments, and return values.
When adding explanatory text or comments for conditional blocks (e.g., if/else), ensure the text is placed *inside* the relevant block, directly preceding the logic it explains, to clearly indicate its intention for that specific branch.
Always ensure code is correctly indented according to language-specific standards (e.g., 4 spaces for Python) to maintain proper structure and readability.
Always use type hints for function parameters and return types.
Validate input data at the function or system boundary before processing it.
When performing operations that expect a specific type (e.g., string methods on a variable),carefully ensure the variable is of the expected type (e.g., string or list).
Always use snake_case for variable and function names in Python.
Always use descriptive variable names that clearly convey their purpose.
Always add prefix 'f_' before function names, for example: f_my_function.
Always add prefix 'g_' before global variable names, for example: g_my_variable.
Always use 'self' as the first parameter name in instance methods.
Always use 'cls' as the first parameter name in class methods.
For TypeScript, always use an underscore for private field names.
Always use triple quotes for multi-line strings in Python.
Always use f-strings for string formatting in Python.
Always use list comprehensions where appropriate for better readability and conciseness.
Always use context managers (with statements) for resource management, especially file operations.
Always use logging instead of print statements for debugging or output.
Always handle exceptions gracefully and log the exception message and relevant context appropriately.
Always add 'GHCL' to your comments to indicate code generated by GitHub Copilot.
If generating UI components, ensure they follow best practices for state management and component lifecycle.
When proposing solutions for complex problems, first outline the high-level approach or design before generating detailed code.
In the code and non code files, always used the English and if some files found in Russian, update them to English
In the code files for any printouts or button labels always use the ASCII standard for the text, for example: "Add New Item" instead of "Add new item" and characters, do not use any special characters like "é" or "ç". Do not use any emojis or special characters in the text.
Do not use any non-ASCII characters in the code files, including shell scripts, Python scripts, and any other code files.
Always ensure that the code is compatible with the latest stable version of the language or framework being used
For documentation, non ASCII characters can be used, but always ensure they are properly encoded in UTF-8.
Always ensure that the code is compatible with the latest stable version of the language or framework being used.

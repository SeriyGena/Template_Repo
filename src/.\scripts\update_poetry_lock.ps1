# Script to update the poetry.lock file to reflect current dependency versions.
# This script regenerates the lock file without changing dependency versions in pyproject.toml.
# Use this script when:
# - You want to lock current dependency versions for deployment
# - Before committing changes to ensure reproducible builds
# - After manually editing pyproject.toml to update the lock file
# - When poetry.lock is out of sync with pyproject.toml
# Run from project root: .\scripts\update_poetry_lock.ps1
